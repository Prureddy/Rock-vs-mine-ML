# Rock-vs-mine-ML

## Overview
``` This repository contains the code for a machine learning project named "Rock-vs-mine-ML." The project aims to classify objects as either "rock" or "mine" using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various features of the objects.```

## Points
### Point 1:
- The project focuses on classifying objects into two categories: "rock" and "mine."
- A logistic regression model is employed for the classification task.
### Point 2:
- The dataset consists of multiple features that describe the objects.
- Logistic regression is a popular binary classification algorithm that works well for such scenarios.
- 
## Dataset
``` The dataset used in this project also provided. It includes labeled samples of objects, where each object is associated with relevant features and a corresponding class label (rock or mine).```

### Code

 ``` The main code files in this repository are as follows:

- data_preprocessing.py: This script handles data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- logistic_regression.py: This script implements the logistic regression model and trains it on the preprocessed data.
- evaluation.py: This script evaluates the trained model's performance using various metrics.
- predict.py: This script allows users to make predictions on new, unseen data using the trained model.
```
## How to Use
